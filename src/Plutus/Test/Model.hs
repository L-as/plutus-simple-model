{- | Simple mock model of Blockchain to unit test plutus contracts and estimate usage of resources.
  What are benefits for this framework. It's:

  * easy to use
  * easy to think about
  * fast
  * can estimate usage of resources with real functions used on Cardano node.
  * pure
  * good for unit testing of onchain code

  We can create simple blockchain data structure and update within context of State monad.
  Update happens as a pure function and along TX-confirmation we have useful stats to estimate usage of resources.

  To create blockchain we first need to specify blockchain config (@BchConfig@).
  Config is specified by protocol parameters (@ProtocolParameters@) and era history (@EraHistory CardanoMode@).
  They are cardano config data types. To avoid gory details it's safe to use predefined config
  and load it with function:

  > readDefaultBchConfig :: IO BchConfig

  It reads config from files stored in the directory @data@. It's yhe only non-pure function that we need to use.

  Once we have config available we can create initial state for blockchain with function:

  > initBch :: BchConfig -> Value -> Blockchain
  > initBch config adminValue = ...

  It creates blockchain that has only one UTXO that belongs to the admin user. The value is how many coins
  we are goint to give to the admin. Admin can distribute values to test users from his reserves.

  The reset of the code happens within @Run@ monad which is thin wrapper on State over Blockchain under the hood.
  We have scenarios of script usages as actions in the @Run@ monad. When we are done we can get the result:

  > runBch :: Run a -> Blockchain -> (a, Blockchain)

  It just runs the state updates.

  Let's create test users:

  > -- alocate 3 users with 1000 lovelaces each
  > setupUsers :: Run [PubKeyHash]
  > setupUsers = replicateM 3 $ newUser $ adaValue 1000

  We can create new user and send values from admin to the user with function:

  > newUser :: Value -> Run PubKeyHash

  Users are identified by thier pub key hashes. Note that admin should have the value that we want to share
  with new user. Otherwise we will get run-time exception.

  Users can send values to each other with function:

  > sendValue :: PubKeyHash -> Value -> PubKeyHash -> Run ()

  Let's share some values:

  > simpleSpend :: Run Bool
  > simpleSpend = do
  >   users <- setupUsers                -- create 3 users and assign each 1000 lovelaces
  >   let [u1, u2, u3] = users           -- give names for users
  >   sendValue u1 (adaValue 100) u2     -- send 100 from user 1 to user 2
  >   sendValue u2 (adaValue 100) u3     -- send 100 from user 2 to user 3
  >   isOk <- noErrors                   -- check that all TXs were accepted without errors
  >   vals <- mapM valueAt users         -- read user values
  >   pure $ and                         -- check test predicate
  >     [ isOk
  >     , vals == fmap adaValue [900, 1000, 1100]
  >     ]

  This example shows how we can create simple tests with library.
  We create three users and exchange the values between the users.
  in the test we check that there are no errors (all TXs were accepted to blockchain) and
  that users have expected values.

  To check for TX errors we use:

  > noErros :: Run Bool

  Blockchain logs all failed transactions to te list @bchFails@. We check that this list is empty.

  To read total value for the user we use:

  > valueAt :: HasAddress addre => addr -> Run Value

  Complete workking example of user exchange can be found at test suites (see @Suites.Plutus.Model.User@)

  So now we know how to send values to users let's learn how to work with scripts.

  When we use function @sendValue@ it creates TX and submits it to blockchain.
  TX defines which UTXOs are used as inputs and what UTXOs we want to produce as outputs.
  As a result (when TX is successful) we destroy input UTXOs and create output UTXOs.

  UTXO can belong to the user (protected by the private PubKey) and can belong to the script (protected by the contract).
  The function @spendValue@ creates TX that uses sender's UTXO as input and signs it with sender's pub key
  and creates receiver's UTXO as output sealed by receiver's pub key hash.

  To post TXs to blockchain we have function:

  > sendTx :: Tx -> Run (Either FailReason Stats)

  It takes plutus Tx and tries to submit it. If it fails it returns he reason of failure.
  If it succeeds it returns statistics of TX execution. It includes TX size if stored on Cardano
  and execution units (execution steps and memory usage). Execution statistics is important to
  know that our transaction is suitable for Cardano network. Cardano has certain limits that we should enforce
  on our TXs.

  Note that comparing to EmulatorTrace we don't need to use waitNSlots to force TX submission.
  It's submited right away and slot counter is updated. If we want to submit block of TXs we
  can use the function:

  > sendBlock :: [Tx] -> Run (Either FailReason [Stats])

  The function @sendTx@ just submits a block with single TX in it. It's ok for most of the cases but
  if we need to test acceptence of several TXs in the block we can use @sendBlock@.

  Let's create Tx and submit it. We will use example of guess hash game script. See code of contracts in the test suite
  (see @Suites.Plutus.Model.Onchain.Game@). Basic description is that anybody can create a Hash puzzle.
  We can hash something and post the hash to blockchain alongside with the prize value. Anyone who can guess
  the origin of hash can take the value.

  For the game we need two TXs. One is to propose the puzzle and another one to solve it and get the prize.
  Let's start with posting a puzzle. For that we need to give something out of our own value and
  create UTXO that is protected by the Game contract.

  Here is the definition:

  > initGame :: PubKeyHash -> Value -> BuiltinByteString -> Run ()
  > initGame pkh prize answer = do                   -- arguments: user, value for the prize, answer for puzzle
  >   sp <- spend pkh prize                          -- read users UTXO that we should spend
  >   tx <- signTx pkh $ initGameTx sp prize answer  -- create TX and sign it with user's secret key
  >   void $ sendTx tx                               -- post TX to blockchain
  >
  > -- pure function ot create TX
  > initGameTx :: Userspend -> Value -> BuiltinByteString -> Tx

  Let's discuss the function bit by bit. To create TX we need to first determine the inputs.
  Input is set of UTXO's that we'd like to spend. For that we use function

  > spend :: PubKeyHash -> Value -> Run UserSpend

  For a given user and value it returns a value of @UserSpend@ which holds
  a set of input UTXOs that cover value that we want spend and also it has change to spend back to user.
  In the UTXO model we can not split the input if it's bigger than we need we need to destroy it
  and create one UTXO that is given to somebody else and another one that is spent back to user.
  We can think about the latter UTXO as a change.

  Note that it going to produce run-time exception if there are not enough funds to spend.
  To avoid run-time errors there is safer variant called @spend'@.

  When we know what inputs to spend we need to make a TX. We do it with function @initGameTx@. We will dicuss it soon.
  After that we should sign TX with the key of the sender. we use functio @signTx@ for that.
  As the last step we post TX and hope that it will execute fine (@sendTx@).

  Let's discuss how to create TX. Here is the solution:

  > initGameTx :: UserSpend -> Value -> BuiltinByteString -> Tx
  > initGameTx usp val answer =
  >   mconcat
  >     [ userSpend usp
  >     , payToScript gameScript (GuessHash $ Plutus.sha2_256 answer) val
  >     ]

  We create transaction by accumulation of monoidal parts. As plutus Tx is monoid it's convenient
  to assemble it from little parts. For our task there are just two parts:

  * for inputs and outputs for user spend
  * pay prize to the script and form right datum for it.

  We use function to make right part for spending the user inputs and sending change back to user:

  > userSpend :: UserSpend -> Tx

  To pay to script we use function:

  > payToScript :: TypedValidator a -> DatumType a -> Value -> Tx

  So it uses validator, datum for it (of proper type) and value to protect with the contract.
  As simple as that.

  Let's create another Tx to post solution to the puzzle. It seems to be more involved but don't be scary
  we will take it bit by bit:

  > guess :: PubKeyHash -> BuiltinByteString -> Run Bool
  > guess pkh answer = do
  >   utxos <- utxoAt gameAddress            -- get game script UTXO
  >   let [(gameRef, gameOut)] = utxos       --   we know there is only one game UTXO
  >   mDat <- datumAt @GameDatum gameRef     -- read game's datum
  >   case mDat of                           -- if there is a datum
  >     Just dat -> do                       -- let's create TX and sign it
  >       tx <- signTx pkh $ guessTx pkh gameRef (txOutValue gameOut) dat answer
  >       isRight <$> sendTx tx              -- let's send TX to blockchain and find out weather it's ok.
  >     Nothing -> pure False

  This function is a bit bigger because now we want to spend not only our funds but also the fund of the script.
  For that we look up the script UTXO (@utxoAt@) and look up it's datum (@datumAt@) and when it all succeeds
  we can form the right TX, sign it with our key and post it to blockchain.

  Functions that query blockchain are often defined on addresses or @TxOutRef@'s:

  > utxoAt  :: Address  -> Run [(TxOutRef, TxOut)]
  > datumAt :: TxOutRef -> Run (Maybe a)

  We should query the datum separately because @TxOut@ contains only hash of it.
  Let's look at the pure function that creates TX. Again we assemble TX from monoidal parts:

  > guessTx :: PubKeyHash -> TxOutRef -> Value -> GameDatum -> BuiltinByteString -> Tx
  > guessTx pkh gameRef gameVal dat answer =
  >   mconcat
  >     [ spendScript gameScript gameRef (Guess answer) dat
  >     , payToPubKey pkh gameVal
  >     ]

  We do two things:

  * spend script with right datum and redeemer
  * pay the prize back to us

  To spend script we use function:

  > spendScript :: TypedValidator a -> TxOutRef -> RedeemerType a -> DatumType a -> Tx

  We provide validator definition, reference to the UTXO of the script, and it's redeemer and datum type.
  We provide datum again because they are not stored on blockchain (only hashes are stored to save the space).

  The next thing is that we want to take the prize. For that we create output that holds the prize and
  protected by our own pub key. we do it with the function:

  > payToPubKey :: PubKeyHash -> Value -> Tx

  * How to work with time

  Note that every time we submit block successfully one slot passes.
  By default one slot lasts for 1 second. Sometimes we want to check for TX that should
  happen in the future or after some time passes.

  For that we can use functions to make blockchain move forward:

  > waitNSlots :: Slot -> Run ()
  > wait       :: POSIXTime -> Run ()
  > waitUntil  :: POSIXTime -> Run ()

  @waitNSlots@ waits in slots while @wait@ and @waitUntil@ wait in POSIXTime (counted in milliseconds).
  Also we can query current time with functions:

  > currentSlot :: Run Slot
  > currentTime :: Run POSIXTime

  By default we always start at the beginning of UNIX epoch. Start of blockchain is set to 0 posix millis.
  Closely related is function @validateIn@. It sets the valid range for TX:

  > validateIn :: POSIXTime -> Tx -> Run Tx

  Note that if current time of blockchain is not included in the Tx it is will be rejected.
  So we can not submit TX that is going to be valid in the future. We rely on property
  thhat all TXs are validated right away. It means  that current time should be included in valid range for TX.
  By default it's @always@, it means any time and should work.

  Also note that because Plutus uses POSIXTime while the Cardano network uses Slots, the inherent
  difference in precision between Slot and POSIXTime may cause unexpected validation failures.
  For example, if we try to build a transaction using the POSIXRange (1100,3400), it will be converted to
  SlotRange (1,4) to go through the Cardano network, and when it is converted back to Plutus, the POSIXRange
  will have been extended to cover the whole slot range, becoming (1000,4000) and maybe trespassing
  the allowed limits set by the validator.

  POSIXTime is counted in milliseconds.
  To count in human readable format we have convinient functions: days, hours, minutes, seconds:

  > wait $ hours 4

  That's it. you can find complete example at the test suite (see @Suites.Plutus.Model.Script.Test.Game@).
  There are other useful function to dicuss. Look up the docs for the @Blockchain@ and @Contract@ modules.

  -- * How to use custom coins

  Often we need to use some custom coins to test the task.
  To create new coin we usually need to create the minting policy script for it and
  setup rules to mint the coins.

  To make this task easy there are "fake" coins provided by the library.
  To create fake coin we can use functions:

  > testCoin :: FakeCoin
  > testCoin = FakeCoin "test-coin-A"
  >
  > fakeValue :: FakeCoin -> Integer -> Value
  > fakeCoin  :: FakeCoin -> AssetClass

  With those functions we can assign some fake coins to admin user on start up of the blockchain:

  > testValue = fakeValue testCoin
  > bch = initBch config (adaValue 1000_000 <> testValue 1000)

  In the blockchain code we can give those fake coins to users when we create them:

  > u1 <- newUser (adaValue 100 <> testValue 10)

  Note that when we send custom value from one user to another we also have to send some minimal ada value.
  In Cardano every UTXO should have some ada in it. EmulatorTrace hides those details but
  in this test framework it's exposed to the user.

  So to send 5 test coins from one user to another add some ada to it:

  > sendValue user1 (adaValue 1 <> testValue 5) user2

  -- * Log custom erros

  We can log our own errors with

  > logErrors :: String -> Run ()

  Errors are saved to log of errors. This way we can report our own errors based on conditions.
  If values are wrong or certain NFt was not created etc.

  also we can log information with:

  > logInfo :: String -> Run ()

  It saves information to the log. the log of errors is unaffected.
  We can read log messages with function:

  > getLog :: Blockchain -> Log BchEvent

  Where BchEvent is one of the events:

  > data BchEvent
  >   = BchTx TxStat           -- ^ Sucessful TXs
  >   | BchInfo String         -- ^ Info messages
  >   | BchFail FailReason     -- ^ Errors
  >

  -- * How to check balances

  There are useful functions to check not absolute balances but blaance transitions.
  We have type @BalanceDiff@ and we can construct it with function:

  > owns  :: HasAddress addr => addr -> Value -> BalanceDiff

  It states that address gained so many coins. we have useful function to check the move of values
  from one address to another

  > gives :: (HasAddress addrFrom, HasAddress addrTo) => addrFrom -> Value -> addrTo -> BalanceDiff

  The type @BalanceDiff@ is a monoid. So we can stack several transitions with @mappend@ and @mconcat@.

  To check the balances we use function:

  > checkBalance :: BalanceDiff -> Run a -> Run a

  It queries balances before application of an action and after application of the action and
  reports any errors. If balances does not match to expected difference.

  For example we can check that sendValue indeed transfers value from one user to another:

  > checkBalance (gives u1 val u2) $ sendValue u1 val u2

  Because TypedValidator has instance of the HasAddress we can also check payments to/from scripts:

  > checkBalance (gives pkh prize gameScript) $ do { ... }

  See more examples at tests for Game and Counter scripts.

  -- * How to use in unit tests

  For convenience there is a function @testNoErrors@:

  > testNoErrors :: Value -> BchConfig -> String -> Run a -> TestTree
  > testNoErrors totalBchFunds bchConfig testMessage script = ...

  It checks that given script runs without errors. Note that if we want to use custom
  checks on run-time values we can query checks inside the script and log errors with @logError@.
  By default it also checks for resource usage constraints.
  If we want to check only logic but not resource usage we can use:

  > skipLimits :: BchConfig -> BchConfig

  -- * How to check TX resource usage

  Sometimes we write too much code in the validators and it starts to exceed execution limits.
  TXs like this can not be executed on chain. To watch out for that we have special functions:

  > testLimits ::
  >    Value
  >    -> BchConfig
  >    -> String
  >    -> (Log TxStat -> Log TxStat)
  >    -> Run a
  >    -> TestTree
  > testLimits totalBchFunds bchConfig testMessage logFilter script

  Let's break apart what it does. It runs blockchain with limit check config set to @WarnLimits@.
  This way we proceed to execute TX on blockchain even if TX exceeds the limits, but we save the
  error every time it happens. When script was run if resource usage errors are encountered
  they are logged to the user in easy to read way.

  To see the logs even on successful run we can add fake error:

  > (script >> logError "Show stats")

  Filter of the log can be useful to filter out some non-related events, for example setup of the
   blockchain users. We typically cn use it like this:

  > good "Reward scripts" (filterSlot (> 4)) (Rewards.simpleRewardTestBy 1)
  >   where
  >     good = testLimits initFunds cfg

  It's good to implement complete set of unit tests first and then add limits tests.
  So that every transformation to optimise on resources is checked by ordinary unit tests.
  On unit tests we can skip limit checks with @skipLimits :: BchConfig -> BchConfig@.
