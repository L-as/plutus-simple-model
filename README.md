Plutus simple model
====================================================

Unit test library for Plutus with estimation of resource usage.

Library defines simple mock model of Blockchain to unit test plutus contracts 
and estimate usage of resources. What are the benefits for this framework? It's:

* easy to use
* easy to think about
* fast
* can estimate usage of resources with real functions used on Cardano node.
* pure
* good for unit testing of on-chain code

### Quick start guide

We can create simple blockchain data structure and update within context of State monad.
Update happens as a pure function and along TX-confirmation we have useful stats to estimate usage of resources.

To create blockchain we first need to specify blockchain config (`BchConfig`).
Config is specified by protocol parameters (`PParams`) and era history (`EraHistory CardanoMode`).
They are cardano config data types. To avoid gory details it's safe to use predefined config
and default parameters for Alonzo era:

```haskell
defaultAlonzo :: BchConfig
```

Once we have config available we can create initial state for blockchain with function:

```haskell
initBch :: BchConfig -> Value -> Blockchain
initBch config adminValue = ...
```

It creates blockchain that has only one UTXO that belongs to the admin user. The value is how many coins
we are going to give to the admin. Admin can distribute values to test users from admin's reserves.

The rest of the code happens within `Run` monad which is a thin wrapper on State over Blockchain under the hood.
We have scenarios of script usages as actions in the `Run` monad. When we are done we can get the result:


```haskell
runBch :: Run a -> Blockchain -> (a, Blockchain)
```

It just runs the state updates.

Let's create test users:

```haskell
-- | alocate 3 users with 1000 lovelaces each
setupUsers :: Run [PubKeyHash]
setupUsers = replicateM 3 $ newUser $ adaValue 1000
```

We can create new user and send values from admin to the user with the function:

```haskell
newUser :: Value -> Run PubKeyHash
```

Users are identified by their pub key hashes. Note that admin should have the value that we want to share
with new user. Otherwise we will get run-time exception.

Users can send values to each other with function:

```haskell
sendValue :: PubKeyHash -> Value -> PubKeyHash -> Run ()
```

Let's share some values:

```haskell
simpleSpend :: Run Bool
simpleSpend = do
  users <- setupUsers                -- create 3 users and assign each 1000 lovelaces
  let [u1, u2, u3] = users           -- give names for users
  sendValue u1 (adaValue 100) u2     -- send 100 from user 1 to user 2
  sendValue u2 (adaValue 100) u3     -- send 100 from user 2 to user 3
  isOk <- noErrors                   -- check that all TXs were accepted without errors
  vals <- mapM valueAt users         -- read user values
  pure $ and                         -- check test predicate
    [ isOk
     , vals == fmap adaValue [900, 1000, 1100]
    ]
```

This example shows how we can create simple tests with library.
We create three users and exchange the values between the users.
In the test we check that there are no errors (all TXs were accepted to blockchain) and
that users have expected values.

To check for TX errors we use:

```haskell
noErrors :: Run Bool
```

Blockchain logs all failed transactions to te list `bchFails`. We check that this list is empty.

To read total value for the user we use:

```haskell
valueAt :: HasAddress addr => addr -> Run Value
```

Complete working example of user exchange can be found at test suites (see `Suites.Plutus.Model.User`)

### Creation of transactions

So now we know how to send values to users. Let's learn how to work with scripts.

When we use function `sendValue` it creates TX and submits it to blockchain.
TX defines which UTXOs are used as inputs and what UTXOs we want to produce as outputs.
As a result (when TX is successful) we destroy input UTXOs and create output UTXOs.

UTXO can belong to the user (protected by the private PubKey) and can belong to the script (protected by the contract).
The function `spendValue` creates TX that uses sender's UTXO as input and signs it with sender's pub key
and creates receiver's UTXO as output sealed by receiver's pub key hash.

To post TXs to blockchain we have function:

```haskell
sendTx :: Tx -> Run (Either FailReason Stats)
```

It takes extended Plutus Tx and tries to submit it. If it fails it returns the reason of failure.
If it succeeds it returns statistics of TX execution. It includes TX size if stored on Cardano
and execution units (execution steps and memory usage). Execution statistics is important to
know that our transaction is suitable for Cardano network. Cardano has certain limits that we should enforce
on our TXs.

Note that `Tx` is not a Plutus TX type. It contains Plutus `Tx` and extra info that we may need
to specify withdrawals of rewards and staking credentials. We need to use the custom type
because staking/credentials is not supported by Plutus TX out of the box. 

Note that comparing to EmulatorTrace we don't need to use waitNSlots to force TX submission.
It's submitted right away and slot counter is updated. If we want to submit block of TXs we
can use the function:

```haskell
sendBlock :: [Tx] -> Run (Either FailReason [Stats])
```

The function `sendTx` just submits a block with single TX in it. It's ok for most of the cases but
if we need to test acceptance of several TXs in the block we can use `sendBlock`.

There is a common pattern for testing to form single TX, sign it with a key and send to network. 
If we don't need to look at the stats we can use function. If it fails it logs the error.

```haskell
submitTx :: PubKeyHash -> Tx -> Run ()
submitTx pkh tx = void $ sendTx =<< signTx pkh tx
```

Let's create Tx and submit it. 

## Typed validators

You might be familiar with the notion of `TypedValdiator` from the library `plutus-ledger`
which comes from the repo `plutus-apps`. In practice `plutus-apps` is heavy-weight and 
often becomes obsolete. To mitigate it's shortcomings in this library we stay at the 
plutus level. We work with types that are supported by `plutus-ledger-api` and
don't use higher-level types from `plutus-ledger`.

Nonetheless it's great to have type-safety and watch out for which datums and redeemers are
applied to specific validators. For that the library `plutus-simple-model` uses 
lightweight wrappers to enforce types for datums and redeemers based on scripts. 
They are defined in the module `Plutus.Test.Model.Validator`.

There are three types of typed valdiators:

* typed validators for scripts: 

  ```haskell
  newtype TypedValidator datum redeemer = TypedValdiator Validator
  ```

* typed minting policies:

  ```haskell
  newtype TypedPolicy redeemer = TypedPolicy MintingPolicy
  ```

* typed stake validators:

  ```haskell
  newtype StakeValidator redeemer = TypedStake StakeValdiator
  ```

We use trick with phantom types to attach type info to the underlying script.
Also we have type class that can extract the type info:

```haskell
class IsValidator script where
  type DatumType    script :: Type
  type RedeemerType script :: Type
  toValidator :: script -> Validator
```

In `plutus-ledger` we created a special tag for example `Game` and we 
instanciated similiar type class called `ValidatorTypes` to specify datum and redeemer tpyes.

In `plutus-simple-model` we have instances of type class `IsValidator` for all typed scripts:
`TypedValidator`, `TypedPolciy` and `TypedStake`. Instead of defining a type tag we
just use it as type synonym for:

```haskell
type Game = TypedValidator GameDatum GameRedeemer
```

We can create validator with plutus or plutarch and wrap it to `TypedValidator`:

```haskell
gameScript :: Game
gameScript = TypedValidator $ mkValidatorScript $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| gameContract ||])
```

We have alias `mkTypedValidator` which combines wrappers:

```haskell
gameScript = mkTypedValidator $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| gameContract ||])
```

Based on this `gameContract` should have type `BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ()`.
But in plutus development we used to write typed valdiators and then wrap them `mkTypedValidator`.

For plutus development there is function to make script defined in type-safe way 
to work on raw builtin data:

```haskell
toBuiltinValidator :: (UnsafeFromData datum, UnsafeFromData redeemer) 
  => (datum -> redeemer -> ScriptContext -> Bool)
  -> (BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ()) 
```

So in plutus development we can define validator:

```haskell
gameContract :: GameDatum -> GameRedeemer -> ScriptContext -> Bool
gameContract = ...

gameScript :: Game
gameScript = TypedValidator $ 
  mkValidatorScript $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| toBuiltinValidator gameContract ||])
```

Similiar functions are defined for minting policies and stake valdiators:

```haskell
mkTypedPolicy :: CompiledCode (BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ()) -> TypedPolicy redeemer
mkTypedStake  :: CompiledCode (BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ()) -> TypedStake redeemer

toBuiltinPolicy :: (UnsafeFromData redeemer)
  => (redeemer -> ScriptContext -> Bool) -> (BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ())

toBuiltinStake :: (UnsafeFromData redeemer)
  => (redeemer -> ScriptContext -> Bool) -> (BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ())
```

## Example of typed validator

Let's define a game of hash guessing. 

```haskell
newtype GameDatum = GuessHash Plutus.BuiltinByteString
  deriving (Eq)

newtype GameAct = Guess Plutus.BuiltinByteString

PlutusTx.unstableMakeIsData ''GameDatum
PlutusTx.unstableMakeIsData ''GameAct```
```

We have some secret bytestring that is hashed with SHA256 and result of hashing
is open to everybody. If user can guess the origin user can take the value of the UTXO.

Let's define a contract for this logic:

```haskell
gameContract :: GameDatum -> GameAct -> ScriptContext -> Bool
gameContract (GuessHash h) (Guess answer) _ =
  Plutus.sha2_256 answer Plutus.== h
```

Let's compile the script and create `TypedValdiator` for testing with our library:

```haskell
import Plutus.Test.Model (toBuiltinValidator, TypedValidator, mkTypedValidator)

type Game = TypedValidator GameDatum GameAct

-- | The GeroGov validator script instance
gameScript :: Game
gameScript = mkTypedValidator $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| toBuiltinValidator gameContract ||])
```

We have to define it in separate module than the types definition otherwise GHC
complains on mixing compilation with QuasiQuotes with derivation of `UnsafeData` instances
with template haskell.

That's it! This is our contract that we are going to test.

## Testing hash game script

Let's initialise the game. For that we spend a prize to the UTXO guarded
by game validator:

```haskell
initGame :: PubKeyHash -> Value -> BuiltinByteString -> Run ()
initGame pkh prize answer = do                   -- arguments: user, value for the prize, answer for puzzle
  sp <- spend pkh prize                          -- read users UTXO that we should spend
  tx <- signTx pkh $ initGameTx sp prize answer  -- create TX and sign it with user's secret key
  void $ sendTx tx                               -- post TX to blockchain

-- pure function ot create TX
initGameTx :: UserSpend -> Value -> BuiltinByteString -> Tx
```

also we can write it with `submitTx`:

```haskell
initGame :: PubKeyHash -> Value -> BuiltinByteString -> Run ()
initGame pkh prize answer = do               -- arguments: user, value for the prize, answer for puzzle
  sp <- spend pkh prize                      -- read users UTXO that we should spend
  submitTx pkh $ initGameTx sp prize answer  -- create TX and sign it with user's secret key and post TX to blockchain
```


Let's discuss the function bit by bit. To create TX we need to first determine the inputs.
Input is set of UTXO's that we'd like to spend. For that we use function

```haskell
spend :: PubKeyHash -> Value -> Run UserSpend
```

For a given user and value it returns a value of `UserSpend` which holds
a set of input UTXOs that cover the value that we want to spend, and also it has change to spend back to user.
In the UTXO model we can not split the input. If it's bigger than we need we have to destroy it
and create one UTXO that is given to someone else and another one that is spent back to user.
We can think about the latter UTXO as a change.

Note that it is going to produce run-time exception if there are not enough funds to spend.
To avoid run-time errors there is safer variant called `spend'`.
Also, we can use safer alternative `withSpend`. It logs an error
if user has no funds to spend and continues execution which can
be helpful in some test cases:

```haskell
withSpend :: PubKeyHash -> Value -> (UserSpend -> Run ()) -> Run ()
```

When we know what inputs to spend we need to make a TX. We do it with function `initGameTx`. We will discuss it soon.
After that we should sign TX with the key of the sender. We use function `signTx` for that.
As the last step we post TX and hope that it will execute fine (`sendTx`).

Let's discuss how to create TX:

```haskell
initGameTx :: UserSpend -> Value -> BuiltinByteString -> Tx
initGameTx usp val answer =
  mconcat
    [ userSpend usp
    , payToScript gameScript (GuessHash $ Plutus.sha2_256 answer) val
    ]
```

We create transaction by accumulation of monoidal parts. As Plutus Tx is monoid it's convenient
to assemble it from tiny parts. For our task there are just two parts:

* for inputs and outputs of user spend
* pay prize to the script and form right datum for it.

We use function to make right part for spending the user inputs and sending change back to user:

```haskell
userSpend :: UserSpend -> Tx
```

To pay to script we use function:

```haskell
payToScript :: IsValidator script => script -> DatumType script -> Value -> Tx
```

So it uses validator, datum for it (of proper type) and value to protect with the contract.
As simple as that. Our type `Game` is `TypedValidator GameDatum GameRedeemer` and
for typed valdiator first tpye argument corresponds to `DatumType`.

Let's create another Tx to post solution to the puzzle. It seems to be more involved but don't be scary.
We will take it bit by bit:

```haskell
guess :: PubKeyHash -> BuiltinByteString -> Run Bool
guess pkh answer = do
  utxos <- utxoAt gameScript             -- get game script UTXO
  let [(gameRef, gameOut)] = utxos       --   we know there is only one game UTXO
  mDat <- datumAt @GameDatum gameRef     -- read game's datum
  case mDat of                           -- if there is a datum
    Just dat -> do                       -- let's create TX and sign it
      tx <- signTx pkh $ guessTx pkh gameRef (txOutValue gameOut) dat answer
      isRight <$> sendTx tx              -- let's send TX to blockchain and find out weather it's ok.
    Nothing -> pure False
```

This function is a bit bigger because now we want to spend not only our funds but also the fund of the script.
For that we look up the script UTXO (`utxoAt`) and look up its datum (`datumAt`) and when it all succeeds
we can form the right TX, sign it with our key and post it to blockchain.

Functions that query blockchain are often defined on addresses or `TxOutRef`'s:

```haskell
utxoAt  :: HasAddress addr => addr -> Run [(TxOutRef, TxOut)]
datumAt :: TxOutRef -> Run (Maybe a)
```

Our `gameScript` has instance of `HasAddress`. It is an address of underlying script.
We should query the datum separately because `TxOut` contains only hash of it.
Let's look at the pure function that creates TX. Again we assemble TX from monoidal parts:

```haskell
guessTx :: PubKeyHash -> TxOutRef -> Value -> GameDatum -> BuiltinByteString -> Tx
guessTx pkh gameRef gameVal dat answer =
  mconcat
    [ spendScript gameScript gameRef (Guess answer) dat
    , payToPubKey pkh gameVal
    ]
```

We do two things:

* spend script with right datum and redeemer
* pay the prize back to us

To spend script we use function:

```haskell
spendScript :: IsValidator script 
  => script -> TxOutRef -> RedeemerType script -> DatumType script -> Tx
```

We provide validator definition, reference to the UTXO of the script, and its redeemer and datum type.

The next thing is that we want to take the prize. For that we create output that holds the prize and
protected by our own pub key. We do it with the function:

```haskell
payToPubKey :: PubKeyHash -> Value -> Tx
```

### How to work with time

Note that every time we submit block successfully one slot passes.
By default, one slot lasts for 1 second. Sometimes we want to check for TX that should
happen in the future or after some time passes.

For that we can use functions to make blockchain move forward:

```haskell
waitNSlots :: Slot -> Run ()
wait       :: POSIXTime -> Run ()
waitUntil  :: POSIXTime -> Run ()
```

`waitNSlots` waits in slots while `wait` and `waitUntil` wait in `POSIXTime` (counted in milliseconds).
Also we can query current time with functions:

```haskell
currentSlot :: Run Slot
currentTime :: Run POSIXTime
```

By default, we always start at the beginning of UNIX epoch. Start of blockchain is set to 0 posix millis.
Closely related is function `validateIn`. It sets the valid range for TX:

```haskell
validateIn :: POSIXTimeRange -> Tx -> Run Tx
```

The result is wrapped in the Run-monad because we convert 
`POSIXTime` to `Slot`'s under the hood and conversion depends on blockchain config.

Note that if current time of blockchain is not included in the Tx it will be rejected.
So we can not submit TX that is going to be valid in the future. We rely on property
that all TXs are validated right away. It means  that current time should be included in valid range for TX.
By default, it's `always`, it means "any time" and should work. 

Also note that because Plutus uses `POSIXTime` while the Cardano network uses Slots, the inherent
difference in precision between Slot and `POSIXTime` may cause unexpected validation failures.
For example, if we try to build a transaction using the `POSIXTimeRange` `(1100,3400)`, it will be converted to
`SlotRange` `(1,4)` to go through the Cardano network, and when it is converted back to Plutus, the POSIXRange
will have been extended to cover the whole slot range, becoming `(1000,4000)` and maybe trespassing
the allowed limits set by the validator.

POSIXTime is counted in milliseconds.
To count in human-readable format we have convenient functions: `days`, `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`:

```haskell
wait $ hours 4
```

That's it. you can find complete example at the test suite (see `Suites.Plutus.Model.Script.Test.Game`).
There are other useful function to dicuss. Look up the docs for the `Blockchain` and `Contract` modules.

### How to use custom coins

Often we need to use some custom coins to test the task.
To create new coin we usually need to create the minting policy script for it and
setup rules to mint the coins.

To make this task easy there are "fake" coins provided by the library.
To create fake coin we can use functions:

```haskell
testCoin :: FakeCoin
testCoin = FakeCoin "test-coin-A"

fakeValue :: FakeCoin -> Integer -> Value
fakeCoin  :: FakeCoin -> AssetClass
```

With those functions we can assign some fake coins to admin user on start up of the blockchain:

```haskell
testValue = fakeValue testCoin
bch = initBch config (adaValue 1000_000 <> testValue 1000)
```

In the blockchain code we can give those fake coins to users when we create them:

```haskell
u1 <- newUser (adaValue 100 <> testValue 10)
```

Note that when we send custom value from one user to another we also have to send some minimal ada value.
In Cardano every UTXO should have some ada in it. EmulatorTrace hides those details but
in this test framework it's exposed to the user.

So to send 5 test coins from one user to another add some ada to it:

```haskell
sendValue user1 (adaValue 1 <> testValue 5) user2
```

### Log custom errors

We can log our own errors with

```haskell
logError :: String -> Run ()
```

Errors are saved to log of errors. This way we can report our own errors based on conditions.
If values are wrong or certain NFT was not created etc.

Also, we can log information with:

```haskell
logInfo :: String -> Run ()
```

It saves information to the log. the log of errors is unaffected.
We can read log messages with function:

```haskell
getLog :: Blockchain -> Log BchEvent
```

Where BchEvent is one of the events:

```haskell
data BchEvent
  = BchTx TxStat           -- ^ Sucessful TXs
  | BchInfo String         -- ^ Info messages
  | BchFail FailReason     -- ^ Errors
```

#### How to skip messages from the logs

All TXs are logged, sometimes we do auxiliary TX that are irrelevant for testing,
and we want to skip the logging of them. For this case we can use function

```haskell
noLog :: Run a -> Run a
```

It executes an action and during execution it omits all logging of TXs and info level messages.
But errors are logged. If we want more fine-grain control we can use `noLogTx` and `noLogInfo`.

#### Logging blockchain state

The ability to observe what's going on in the blockchain is a great way to understand things.
To log balances use `logBchState` action, which saves current state as a log entry. To show
log use `testNoErrorsTrace` helper (see below).

### How to check balances

There are useful functions to check not absolute balances but balance transitions.
We have type `BalanceDiff` and we can construct it with function:

```haskell
owns  :: HasAddress addr => addr -> Value -> BalanceDiff
```

It states that address gained so many coins. We have useful function to check the move of values
from one address to another

```haskell
gives :: (HasAddress addrFrom, HasAddress addrTo) => addrFrom -> Value -> addrTo -> BalanceDiff
```

The type `BalanceDiff` is a monoid. So we can stack several transitions with `mappend` and `mconcat`.

To check the balances we use function:

```haskell
checkBalance :: BalanceDiff -> Run a -> Run a
```

It queries balances before application of an action and after application of the action and
reports any errors. If balances does not match to expected difference.

For example, we can check that sendValue indeed transfers value from one user to another:

```haskell
checkBalance (gives u1 val u2) $ sendValue u1 val u2
```

If we want to check that user or script preserved the value we can set it up with `(owns user mempty)`.
Because TypedValidator has instanced of the HasAddress we can also check payments to/from scripts:

```haskell
checkBalance (gives pkh prize gameScript) $ do { ... }
```

Sometimes we need to check balances based on result of the action. For that we have generic 
function `checkBalanceBy`:

```haskell
checkBalanceBy :: (a -> BalanceDiff) -> Run a -> Run a
```

See more examples at tests for `Game` and `Counter` scripts.


### How to use in unit tests

For convenience there is a function `testNoErrors`:

```haskell
testNoErrors :: Value -> BchConfig -> String -> Run a -> TestTree
testNoErrors totalBchFunds bchConfig testMessage script = ...
```

It checks that given script runs without errors. Note that if we want to use custom
checks on run-time values we can query checks inside the script and log errors with `logError`.
By default, it also checks for resource usage constraints.

A more verbatim alternative is `testNoErrorsTrace` which is the same, but prints out 
the blockchain log on both failures and successes. The output might be rather excessive,
so use it judiciously. Probably it's worth using one of these functions depending on the
runtime "dump log" parameter value (if you use `tasty` you might want to use an `Ingredient`
to implement this).

If we want to check only logic but not resource usage we can use:

```haskell
skipLimits :: BchConfig -> BchConfig
```

Also, there is function `warnLimits` that logs errors of resources usage
but does not fail TX for submission. So if logic is correct script will run but
errors of resources will be logged to error log.

### How to write negative tests

Often we need to check for errors also. We have to be sure that some 
TX fails. Maybe this TX is malicious one, and we have to be sure that it can not pass.
For that we have useful function:

```haskell
mustFail :: Run a -> Run a
mustFail action = ...
```

It saves the current state of blockchain and 
tries to run the `action` and if the action succeeds it logs an error
but if action fails it does not log error and retrieves the stored previous
blockchain state. 

This way we can ensure that some scenario fails, and we can proceed
the execution of blockchain actions.

### How to fail with custom conditions

We can also fail on custom conditions with function `logError`:

```haskell
unless checkCondition $ logError "Some invariant violated"
```

### How to check TX resource usage

Sometimes we write too much code in the validators, and it starts to exceed execution limits.
TXs like this can not be executed on chain. To watch out for that we have special function:

```haskell
testLimits ::
   Value
   -> BchConfig
   -> String
   -> (Log TxStat -> Log TxStat)
   -> Run a
   -> TestTree
testLimits totalBchFunds bchConfig testMessage logFilter script
```

Let's break apart what it does. It runs blockchain with limit check config set to @WarnLimits@.
This way we proceed to execute TX on blockchain even if TX exceeds the limits, but we save the
error every time it happens. When script was run if resource usage errors are encountered
they are logged to the user in easy to read way.

To see the logs even on successful run we can add fake error:

```haskell
(script >> logError "Show stats")
```

The results are shown in the percentage to the mainnet limit. We need to care
that all of them are below 100%. Also note that we'd better have some headroom 
and keep it not close to 100% because number of inputs in TX is unpredictable.
we can aggregate input values for the scripts from many UTXOs. So we'd better have 
the free room available for extra UTXOs.

Filter of the log can be useful to filter out some non-related events. for example setup of the blockchain
users. We typically cn use it like this:

```haskell
good "Reward scripts" (filterSlot (> 4)) (Rewards.simpleRewardTestBy 1)
  where
    good = testLimits initFunds cfg
```

It's good to implement complete set of unit tests first and then add limits tests.
So that every transformation to optimise on resources is checked by ordinary unit tests.
On unit tests we can skip limit checks with `skipLimits :: BchConfig -> BchConfig`.

### Box - a typed TxOut

Often when we work with scripts we need to read `TxOut` to get datum hash to
read the datum next and after that we specify how datum is updated on TX.

Enter the Box - typed `TxOut`. The `Box` is `TxOut` augmented with typed datum. 
We can read Box for the script with the function:

```haskell
boxAt :: (IsValidator script) => script -> Run [TxBox (DatumType script)]
```

It reads the typed box. We can use it like this: 

```haskell
gameBox <- head <$> boxAt @Game gameScript
```

Sometimes it's useful to read the box by NFT, since often scripts are identified by unque NFTs:

```haskell
nftAt :: (IsValidator script) => script -> Run (TxBox (DatumType script))
nftAt tv = ...
```

So let's look at the box:

```haskell
-- | Typed txOut that contains decoded datum
data TxBox datum = TxBox
  { txBoxRef   :: TxOutRef    -- ^ tx out reference
  , txBoxOut   :: TxOut       -- ^ tx out
  , txBoxDatum :: datum       -- ^ datum
  }

txBoxValue :: TxBox a -> Value
```

It has everything that `TxOut` has, but also we have our typed datum.
There are functions that provide typical script usage. 

We can just spend boxes as scripts:

```haskell
spendBox :: (IsValidator v) => 
  v -> RedeemerType v -> TxBox (DatumType v) -> Tx
spendBox tv redeemer box
```

The most generic function is `modifyBox`:

```haskell
modifyBox :: (IsValidator v) 
  => v -> TxBox (DatumType v) -> RedeemerType v 
  -> (DatumType v -> DatumType v) 
  -> (Value -> Value) 
  -> Tx
modifyBox tv box redeemer updateDatum updateValue
```

It specifies how we update the box datum and value. 
Also, often we use boxes as oracles:

```haskell
readOnlyBox :: (IsValidator v)
  => v -> TxBox (DatumType v) -> RedeemerType v -> Tx
```

It keeps the datum and value the same.

### How to pay to the addresses with staking credentials

We can append the information on staking credential to
anything that is convertible to `Address` by `HasAddress` type class
with constructor `AppendStaking`. Also, we have utility functions
`appendStakingPubKey` and `appendStakingScript` which
append `PubKeyHash` and `ValidatorHash` as staking credential.

For example, we can append it to the `TypeValidator` of the script:

```haskell
payToScript (appendStakingPubKey stakingKey typedValidator) datum value
```

That's why we use not `TypedValidator` in the payToScript and similiar functions.
It turns out that if `v` is `IsValidator` and `HasAddress` then `AppendStaking v` 
is also `IsValidator` and `HasAddress` and correct datum and redeemer types are set up.

So we can use the same functions with scritps that have some staking info attached to them.
Let's recall the type:

```haskell
payToScript :: (IsValidator v) => v -> DatumType v -> Value -> Tx
```

The same function exists to pay to pub key hash:

```haskell
payToPubKey :: HasAddress pubKeyHash => pubKeyHash -> Value -> Tx
```

### Certificates and withdrawals of the rewards

In cardano staking pools are driving force behind confirmation of transactions.
For the work pool owners receive fees. The fees get distributed among 
staking credentials that delegate to pool. 

So we have staking pool operator (SPO) who is chosen for this round to
confirm TX. And for this work SPO gets the fees. Fees are collected 
to the addresses that are called staking credentials. Users can delegate staking credential
to the pool owner (SPO). 

So far we have ignored the fees, but in real scenario every transaction should contain fees.
To pay fee in the transaction we can use function. The fees are fairly distributed among
all staking credentials that belong to the pool:

```haskell
-- Pay fee for TX confirmation. The fees are payed in ADA (Lovelace)
payFee :: Ada -> Tx
```
The `Ada` is a newtpye wrapper over `Integer` that specifies amount of lovelaces.
It is defined in the module `Plutus.Test.Model.Ledger.Ada`.


#### How reward distribution works

For each round of TX confirmation there is a pool called **leader** that confirms
TX. For that the pool receives fees and fairly distributes them among stake credentials
that delegate to that pool.

For this testing framework we go over a list of pools one by one and on each TX-confirmation
we choose the next pool. All staking credentials delegated to the pool receive equal amount of fees.
When blockchain initialised we have a single pool id and stake credential that 
belongs to the admin (user who owns all funds on genesis TX). 

So to test some Stake validator we need to register it in the blockchain
and delegate it to admin's pool. We can get the pool of the admin by calling `(head <$> getPools)`.
This gives the pool identifier of the only pool that is registered.
After that we create TX that registers taking credential and delegates it to admin's pool.
We can provide enough fees for that TX to check the stake validator properties. 

As an example we can use the test-case in the module `Suites.Plutus.Model.Script.Test.Staking`.
It implements a basic stake validator and checks that it works (see the directory `test` for this repo).


#### Certificates

To work with pools and staking credentials we use certificates (`DCert` in Plutus).
We have functions that trigger actions with pools and staking credentials:

First we need to register staking credential by pub key hash (rewards belong to certain key)
or by the script. For the script there is guarding logic that regulates spending of rewards
for staking credential. For the key we require that TX is signed by the given key to spend the reward.

```haskell
registerStakeKey    :: PubKeyHash -> Tx

registerStakeScript :: TypedStake redeemer -> Tx
```

Also we can deregistrate the staking credential:

```haskell
deregisterStakeKey    :: PubKeyHash -> Tx

deregisterStakeScript :: IsValidator (TypedStake redeemer) => 
  TypedStake redeemer -> redeemer -> Tx
```

A staking credential can get rewards only over a pool. To associate it with pool
we use the function delegate:

```haskell
delegateStakeKey    :: PubKeyHash -> PoolId -> Tx

delegateStakeScript :: IsValidator (TypedStake redeemer) => 
  TypedStake redeemer -> redeemer -> PoolId -> Tx
```

The type `PoolId` is just a `newtype` wrapper for `PubKeyHash`:

```haskell
newtype PoolId = PoolId { unPoolId :: PubKeyHash }
```

As blockchain starts we have only one pool and staking credential associated with it.
It is guarded by admin's pub key hash.

We can register or deregister (retire) pools with functions:

```haskell
registerPool :: PoolId -> Tx
retirePool   :: PoolId -> Tx
```
Alas above functions do not work (need to fix conversion to VrfKey) at the moment.
Use direct insertion/removal of pools with `insertPool` and `deletePool` to manage stake pools:

```haskell
insertPool :: PoolId -> Run ()
deletePool :: PoolId -> Run ()
```

For staking validators each of those functions is going to trigger validation with purpose
`Certifying DCert`. Where `DCert` can be one of the following:

```haskell
data DCert
  = DCertDelegRegKey StakingCredential     -- register stake
  | DCertDelegDeRegKey StakingCredential   -- deregister stake
  | DCertDelegDelegate                     -- delegate stake to pool
      StakingCredential
      -- ^ delegator
      PubKeyHash
      -- ^ delegatee
  | -- | A digest of the PoolParams
    DCertPoolRegister                     -- register pool
      PubKeyHash
      -- ^ poolId
      PubKeyHash
      -- ^ pool VFR
  | -- | The retiremant certificate and the Epoch N
    DCertPoolRetire PubKeyHash Integer   -- retire the pool 
                                         -- NB: Should be Word64 but we only have Integer on-chain
  | -- | A really terse Digest
    DCertGenesis                         -- not supported for testing yet
  | -- | Another really terse Digest
    DCertMir                             -- not supported for testing yet
```

#### Query staking credentials and pools

We can collect various stats during execution on how many coins we have for rewards
and where staking credential belongs to.

```haskell
-- get all pools
getPools :: Run [PoolId]

-- get staking credential by pool
stakesAt :: PoolId -> Run [StakingCredential]

-- get rewards for a StakingCredential, PubKeyHash and StakeValidator or TypedStake
rewardAt :: HasStakingCredential cred => cred -> Run Integer

-- query if pool is registered
hasPool :: PoolId -> Run Bool

-- query if staking credential is registered
hasStake :: HasStakingCredential cred => cred -> Run Bool
```

#### Utility functions to create staking credentials

We can create staking credential out of pub key hash or stake validator
with function:

```haskell
toStakingCredential :: HasStakingCredential a => a -> StakingCredential
```

#### Withdrawals of the rewards

When staking credential has some rewards we can withdraw it and send
to some address. To do it we need to spend all rewards, so we need to 
provide exact amount that is stored in the rewards of the staking credential
at the time of TX confirmation. 

We can query the current amount with function `rewardAt`:

```haskell
-- get rewards for a StakingCredential
rewardAt :: StakingCredential -> Run Integer
```

To get rewards we need to include in transaction this part:

```haskell
withdrawStakeKey    :: PubKeyHash -> Integer -> Tx

withdrawStakeScript :: (IsValidator script) => 
  TypedStake script -> RedeemerType script -> Integer -> Tx
```

As with certificates we can withdraw by pub key hash (needs to be signed by that key)
and also by validator. 

To test withdraws we need to have rewards. We can easily generate rewards by 
making transactions that contain fees granted with `payFee` function.

## Ledger reexports

As plutus-ledger is not available with removing plutus-apps dependency. 
We still provide some useful functionality from it. It's placed under `Plutus.Test.Model.Ledger`:

* `Ledger.Ada`  - `Ada` type wrapper and functions for it
* `Ledger.Scripts` - useful functions to calculate hashes
